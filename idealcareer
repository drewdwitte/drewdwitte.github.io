<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>My outline to get this job would be to first get my high school diploma. I would then get a commercial driver's license in order to drive the truck. That means that I will have to be 21 and have no disqualifying criminal offenses. After tha I'll apply and hopefully become a garbage man </p>
