      <h2>Testemonial</h2>
      <p>This book is my favorite because it combines a complex tale of intrigue and deception with a unique storytelling method.
        
      <h3>Summary</h3>
     <p>In the years shortly preceding the French Revolution, two aristocrats, The Vicomte de Valmont and Madame Merteuil scheme together in order avenge themselves upon Gercourt, who has shamed them both. 
     Their primary plan revolves around Valmont "getting acquainted" with Gercourt's young bride-to-be, Cecile, beofre their wedding night.
       However, there are some upsets in their plan. One of the primary hindrances to the plan is Valmont's obession with the newly married Madame de Tourvel.
       To Merteuil's intense annoyance, Valmont will only agree to go along with her plan when he has finally made Madame de Tourvel love him. 
       By the end of the novel, both Valmont's and Merteuil's objectives are completed but then, Merteuil mocks Valmont by saying that she can't belive how weak he's become by falling in love.
       Valmont denies this claim and ceases contact with Tourvel. This causes her to fall into an intense depression and then die of grief. Realizing that this was Merteuil's plan all along, Valmont goes to publish the letters between them and dies in a duel shortly after.
       The novel ends with everybody involved on the story suffering for their actions.</P>
